## Recommended Screenshot Types

For comprehensive documentation, consider taking the following types of screenshots:

1. **Title Screen**: The main title screen of the game
2. **Gameplay**: The main game screen during active gameplay
3. **Tweet Effects**: Examples of different tweet effects

5. **Game Over**: The game over screen
6. **Win Screen**: The victory screen

## Screenshot Naming Convention

Use a consistent naming convention for screenshots:

```
tariff-tycoon-[screen-name]-[optional-description].png
```

Examples:
- `tariff-tycoon-title-screen.png`
- `tariff-tycoon-gameplay-year2.png`
- `tariff-tycoon-crony-cards.png`

## Screenshot for README

The main `README.md` file references a screenshot at `screenshots/game-preview.png`. This should be a high-quality screenshot of the main gameplay that showcases the game's features and visual style.

## Image Optimization

Before committing screenshots to the repository, consider optimizing them to reduce file size:

1. Use PNG format for screenshots with transparency or pixel art
2. Use JPEG format for screenshots with many colors and no transparency
3. Optimize images using tools like:
   - [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
   - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) (macOS)
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) (Web-based)

## Creating GIFs

For showcasing animations or gameplay sequences, consider creating GIFs:

1. Record a short video of the game using screen recording software
2. Convert the video to GIF using tools like:
   - [GIPHY Capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture) (macOS)
   - [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (Windows)
   - [Peek](https://github.com/phw/peek) (Linux)
3. Optimize the GIF using [EZGif](https://ezgif.com/optimize) or similar tools

## Placeholder Image

Until you take actual screenshots of the game, you can use a placeholder image. Create a simple image with text indicating it's a placeholder, or use a mockup of what the game will look like.
